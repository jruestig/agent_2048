# A 2048 Agent

This Repository holds:
A python implementation of 2048 in Numpy for fast computation

A Monte Carlo roll out model that computes smooth action values, where a
suboptimal move is just discounted through its negative influence on the mean.


To start and view the agents just run the python scripts

1) montecarlo.py  (requirement numpy)

2) qvaluenetwork.py  (requirement numpy, keras, tensorflow as backend)
